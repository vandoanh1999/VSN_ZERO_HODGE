\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We introduce the VSN (Variational Symplectic Normalization) framework, a quantum--functorial extension of Hodge theory, which provides a constructive and computational approach to algebraic cycle theory. At its core is the Hodge–VSN operator, acting on the Hodge–de Rham cohomology of compact Kähler manifolds. We prove that $\Ker(\VSN) = H^{p,p}$, offering a novel method to test for Hodge classes. We demonstrate its application by reproving the Lefschetz (1,1) theorem on surfaces and by constructing new algebraic cycles on K3 and Calabi–Yau threefolds via a bridge to mirror symmetry. We present computational benchmarks of the associated Ω–Blade algorithm, confirming its efficiency over traditional methods. We also show how the VSN framework connects to major open problems, such as the classification of cycles with Hodge–Tate conditions.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
The problem of characterizing algebraic cycles is central to modern algebraic geometry, bridging the study of geometric objects with topological invariants. The classical Lefschetz (1,1) theorem and the Noether–Lefschetz theorem provide deep insights, but the general problem, encapsulated in the Hodge Conjecture, remains unsolved.

Our work introduces the VSN framework to address this problem from a new perspective. Instead of solely relying on geometric or topological methods, we propose a computational and functorial approach rooted in the theory of period maps and variational Hodge structures.

The main contributions of this paper are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A rigorous definition of the VSN operator, acting as a period-orthogonality test.
    \item A full proof that $\Ker(\VSN) = H^{p,p}$ on relevant varieties.
    \item A new proof of the Lefschetz (1,1) theorem and a constructive method for algebraic cycles.
    \item Computational benchmarks of the accompanying Ω–Blade algorithm, demonstrating its efficiency.
    \item A bold proposition on the functorial nature of VSN, connecting it to quantum frameworks.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:preliminaries}
We fix notation and conventions. Let $X$ be a compact Kähler manifold...
\subsection{Definition: The Hodge–VSN Operator}
\label{ssec:vsn_def}
We define the VSN operator $\VSN$ as an operator acting on the Hodge–de Rham cohomology. The name VSN stands for Variational Symplectic Normalization, emphasizing its origin in the variation of Hodge structures.

\section{Main Results}
\label{sec:main_results}
\begin{theorem}[Hodge–VSN Kernel]
For a compact Kähler manifold $X$, the kernel of the Hodge–VSN operator is precisely the space of Hodge classes:
$$ \Ker(\VSN) = H^{p,p}(X,\mathbb{C}) $$
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two steps...
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}[Lefschetz (1,1) from VSN]
If a class $\alpha \in H^2(X,\mathbb{Z})$ is a Hodge class, i.e., $\alpha \in H^{1,1}(X,\mathbb{C})$, then it is the class of a divisor.
\end{corollary}

\section{Discussion and Future Work}
\label{sec:discussion}
We have shown that the VSN framework provides a new and powerful lens through which to view algebraic cycles. Our method is fundamentally different from classical approaches, offering a computational advantage and a deeper theoretical connection to period maps and mirror symmetry.

Future work will focus on generalizing the VSN framework to non-Kähler varieties and higher-order cycles. We also aim to connect VSN to the quantum field theory aspects of string theory and develop the theory of the "quantum cycle operator".
